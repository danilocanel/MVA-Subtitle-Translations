00:00:12,483 --> 00:00:20,466
>> Let's go into our next module and kind of take it up a notch here.

3
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:23,466
We're going to go up into the advanced SELECT statements,

4
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,466
and in the advanced SELECT statements, we're going to talk in

5
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:29,466
here, as we move down through here, we're going to talk about

6
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:34,466
things like the DISTINCT clause, the aliases, scalar functions,

7
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:39,466
using a CASE, JOINs and MERGEs. We're going to introduce those.

8
00:00:39,483 --> 00:00:44,383
Filtering data, sorting data and how we work with the null values.

9
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:46,466
So we're going to take down what we just introduced in module

10
00:00:46,483 --> 00:00:49,466
one, and we're going to take it up a notch and start working

11
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:53,466
with some of these advanced options that we have available to us.

12
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:55,250
And we kind of introduced a little bit... we did a little bit

13
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:57,466
of the sorting and the filtering when we used the Where clause

14
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:00,466
already, didn't do much with JOINs, but now we're going to talk

15
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:03,466
about a few of these other more advanced clauses that we can

16
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:06,333
use with the SELECT statement.

17
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:09,466
Tobias, how does this DISTINCT statement help me out here?

18
00:01:10,0 --> 00:01:15,466
>> The DISTINCT is all about removing duplicates in a set, and

19
00:01:16,483 --> 00:01:18,466
you typically use it for

20
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:24,466
you want to list all of the first names in a table, and you have

21
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:27,466
lots of Johns and even more Tobiases, because it's obviously

22
00:01:27,483 --> 00:01:32,400
a very common name. And so if you just say SELECT first name

23
00:01:32,483 --> 00:01:36,466
from employees or whatever, it will just give you all of the

24
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:38,466
names in no particular order, but if you say DISTINCT, it will

25
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,466
give you the unique combination across all columns, so that's

26
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:45,466
an important thing to remember. DISTINCT goes across the entire row.

27
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:49,233
It doesn't look at for a specific column. So it's across the

28
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:52,466
entire row that you've selected that you're projecting, and then

29
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:58,466
gives you the result back without the duplicates. It's important

30
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:03,466
to know the DISTINCT is typically a fairly expensive statement

31
00:02:03,483 --> 00:02:07,466
to run, so the larger the set, the more work we have to do to

32
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:11,466
approve these duplicates. It typically includes sorting the result

33
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:14,466
first and then walking through and removing it, so kind of like

34
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:17,466
you would imagine if you would need to remove duplicates from

35
00:02:17,233 --> 00:02:19,466
a set, you would have to do something like that.

36
00:02:20,483 --> 00:02:25,466
>> All right. And then here's an example of using a SELECT DISTINCT StoreID.

37
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:28,466
So if I just did a SELECT StoreID from Sales.Customer, it's going

38
00:02:28,483 --> 00:02:32,466
to display multiple occurrences of StoreID. By throwing the

39
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:35,466
DISTINCT clause in there, now it's going to just show me every

40
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:38,466
StoreID, or it's going to show it just once, every StoreID, which

41
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:40,466
makes it like you said. It's a little bit more overhead, but

42
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:43,466
my result set is going to have fewer items returned to me.

43
00:02:43,483 --> 00:02:46,466
>> And it's important, this thing about performance. We'll probably

44
00:02:46,483 --> 00:02:48,466
talk a bit about performance over the day.

45
00:02:49,483 --> 00:02:53,250
But first comes functionality, right? You first need to get the

46
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:55,466
results that you're actually interested in, and then you want

47
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:59,466
to optimize this. And obviously, with regards to your results,

48
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,466
the more you can constrain it and the more you can understand

49
00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:06,200
exactly what's needed, probably the more you can tweak the performance.

50
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:09,250
But at the end of the day, you can't use a blanket statement

51
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,466
like never use DISTINCT, because if you don't want the duplicates

52
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,466
in there, presumably you should use DISTINCT.

53
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,466
>> Yes. As long as you understand the overhead involved, as I

54
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,466
said, there are going to be times when you're going to have to

55
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:23,466
use it, but as long as you understand the overhead that's involved

56
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:26,466
with that, you're going to be able to run with that. Here's some

57
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:30,466
using aliases. Those help kind of format. Again, we're going

58
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:33,466
to look at the different ways we could control the results and

59
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:36,466
our result set, so we have calling the aliases here, where we've

60
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:41,466
got select SalesOrderID, UnitPrice, order quantity, as quantity.

61
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:43,466
So that's how that's going to display that. So this is using

62
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:47,466
adding an alias for a column by using the AS clause. We can

63
00:03:47,483 --> 00:03:52,466
do something very similar by just using the new column editor.

64
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:56,466
We put Quantity = OrderQty, so we kind of flipped these around

65
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:59,466
without the AS clause, so where the new column header is to the

66
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:03,466
left of the equal sign, as it is in comparison to the right of

67
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:07,466
the AS. You can also accidental column aliases. I like this one.

68
00:04:07,483 --> 00:04:12,316
We have sales order ID, unit price and quantity from Sales.SalesOrderDetail.

69
00:04:12,483 --> 00:04:17,466
Notice I didn't put a comma after unit price, so this is why

70
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:21,466
it's an accidental alias. What this will do is it will actually

71
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:26,466
give me content that is the unit price with the header of Quantity.

72
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:29,466
Is that the right order, or am I going the other way? I can't remember.

73
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:30,466
We'll see it.

74
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:35,466
Because there's content in there without the comma, it's identifying

75
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,183
Quantity as the column header, but it's going to actually display

76
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,466
the UnitPrice in there.

77
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,466
>> So with regards to this, you may wonder, why do I have three

78
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:47,466
different ways to do the same thing? Is it just that people are confused?

79
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:52,466
No. So, basically, AS is what you should use. AS is what is

80
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:57,466
defined in the ANSI SQL standard. Why we support equals and

81
00:04:57,483 --> 00:05:01,466
basically without making AS optional, so that's what you see

82
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,466
at the bottom there, is because of legacy reasons. So one of

83
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:09,400
the things that we do very well in SQL Server is keep backwards

84
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:13,383
compatibility working for you. So basically, if we introduce

85
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:17,466
something, even if it's a long, long time ago, you can still

86
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:22,166
run the command today. The only time we go and remove it is basically

87
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,200
if it's causing problems. So we highly recommend you use AS,

88
00:05:26,283 --> 00:05:29,466
as that's the ANSI SQL way of writing it, but these other ways

89
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:30,466
exist, as well.

90
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:35,466
>> All right, so kind of the idea of aliases is it makes the column

91
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:37,466
headers a little bit more manageable, because sometimes whoever

92
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:41,466
designed the database may not have the most user-friendly column headers.

93
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:44,466
Now we can define those a little bit differently. Aliases to

94
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:46,466
refer to tables, you saw how we did that a little bit earlier.

95
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:51,466
We've got SELECT SalesOrderID, ProductID, from this table Sales.SalesOrderDetail

96
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:57,466
AS SalesOrders. Now I can reference this table as SalesOrders

97
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:00,466
in future statements here. This is some more to the columns.

98
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:03,466
Now it's without the AS, and then we have table aliases in a

99
00:06:03,483 --> 00:06:08,466
SELECT clause, and that's what we did earlier, in my demo earlier.

100
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:12,466
Once I define, or if I identify SalesOrders up here with the

101
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,466
AS clause, or if I use an AS clause, I have to specify that in

102
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:21,466
the SELECT statement. So that's just the use of the tables as

103
00:06:21,483 --> 00:06:22,466
an alias.

104
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,466
>> So why would you use these table aliases?

105
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,466
>> Well, if you're doing... we're going to talk about JOINs.

106
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:30,466
If you're going to be able to reference, maybe, a table or multiple

107
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:34,466
tables or a table multiple times using different names, like

108
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:37,466
within a JOIN, these are going to be beneficial when we see the

109
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:39,166
JOINs a little bit later.

110
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,466
>> Yes, and it will also help you from typing too much. If you

111
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:46,416
need to reference this table name all the time, it will help

112
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,466
you if you use aliases and make them shorter.

113
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,466
>> CASE expressions. A simple CASE expression, we'll talk about those.

114
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:58,433
This allows us to compare a value to a list of possible values

115
00:06:58,483 --> 00:07:00,466
and then perform some...

116
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:05,466
a statement based on the results of that. CASE expressions may

117
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:09,466
be used in your SELECT column, where having clauses or your ORDER

118
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:14,466
BY clause. And an example of these is shown here, where we have

119
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:15,466
SelectProductID, Name

120
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,466
and ProductSubCategoryID, CASE ProductSubCategoryID, WHEN 1,

121
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:23,466
then it equals to Beverages. ELSE, it's an unknown category.

122
00:07:23,483 --> 00:07:26,466
So pretty much it's going to go down through, and when it finds

123
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:30,433
that the ProductSubCategoryID is equal to 1, we're going to know

124
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:34,466
that it's Beverages. Otherwise, it's going to show it as an Unknown Category.

125
00:07:34,483 --> 00:07:37,416
So when I do a demo, I'll show you this command specifically

126
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:40,466
so that you have a better idea here as to what this looks like

127
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:40,466
in action.

128
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:44,466
In fact, let's do that now.

129
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,466
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back into my image,

130
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:54,466
and so

131
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,350
I'm going to go in and I'm going to load a statement up, a query

132
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:05,466
that I had written already. You guys don't want to watch me fat

133
00:08:06,483 --> 00:08:08,466
finger everything, so I've got some statements here. We talked

134
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:11,466
a little bit about the DISTINCT here, so we can just run that

135
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:15,466
real quick so we can see that in action. So SELECT DISTINCT StoreID.

136
00:08:15,483 --> 00:08:19,466
Let me grab this. So we can run this one here.

137
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:25,466
Click again. Here's the StoreID is null. Then we start getting...

138
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,466
wrong window. Then you'll see that we've got some... well, first

139
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:32,466
off, let's look at this. We've got 711 rows.

140
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:35,466
So if we ran this again,

141
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,466
and let's just remove this temporarily,

142
00:08:40,483 --> 00:08:42,466
and then we run this same statement

143
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,466
and we return it. Now we have 19,820 rows. That's the idea of

144
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:50,466
removing those duplicates that we discussed a little bit ago.

145
00:08:51,483 --> 00:08:55,466
So we can do that. These are the aliases. We've already seen

146
00:08:55,483 --> 00:08:59,0
these in action, so we won't worry about these too much.

147
00:08:59,483 --> 00:09:03,466
Let's go ahead and take a look at here's that CASE statement.

148
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:05,466
I want to show you that actually in action. So I'm going to

149
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:08,466
go ahead and execute this. We've already walked you through and

150
00:09:08,483 --> 00:09:12,366
talked about it, so we'll execute that now, and you'll see now

151
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,466
that we've got ProductID, we've got Name, ProductSubCategoryID,

152
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:19,466
so that's an unknown. If I scroll down, remember, we're looking

153
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:24,466
for Win 1, so if I scroll down here, we could have multiple items here.

154
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:28,466
You'll see now, when I see number one, we're getting Beverages displayed.

155
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:32,466
Everything else, twos, threes through whatever other number,

156
00:09:32,483 --> 00:09:36,200
no values are going to display Unknown Category. So it allows

157
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:39,466
us to control what's actually shown here when we're actually

158
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:43,466
performing or running a CASE statement. We can control what's

159
00:09:44,0 --> 00:09:45,466
displayed in that column.

160
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:48,466
>> And it's important to know that the CASE statement, it's not

161
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:51,466
a statement, it's an expression. It's a function, so you can

162
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:56,466
use it in any statement, more or less. You can use it in update,

163
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:59,466
set something equals to CASE something or in the ORDER BY clause

164
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:04,400
or in the group by clause or in the ON clause, or whatever.

165
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:07,466
So wherever you can run a function, you can sue the CASE expression.

166
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:12,466
>> JOINs. JOINs are powerful, maybe a little bit confusing sometimes.

167
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:14,466
We're going to talk about JOINs next.

168
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:18,266
And in the JOINs, we've got a few different flavors of JOINs.

169
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,466
We have CROSS JOINs, INNER JOINs and OUTER JOINs, and it can

170
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:25,466
be a little overwhelming, but just as an introduction, CROSS

171
00:10:25,183 --> 00:10:30,333
JOINs combines all rolls in both tables, sometimes creates what's

172
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:34,466
called a Cartesian product. INNER JOINs provides filter to match

173
00:10:34,483 --> 00:10:39,466
rows between the tables, and then the OUTER JOINs display all

174
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:43,466
rows from a designated table, and then it matches rows from the

175
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:46,466
other contents being retrieved from.

176
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:50,466
So INNER JOINs, as we just introduced, are just rows where a

177
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:55,466
match is found in both tables. An example of this is we'll start

178
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:59,166
from the bottom... so I mentioned the idea of having an alias,

179
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,466
so I'm going to just jump down to here, where we've got FROM

180
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,466
Sales.SalesOrderHeader AS SOH. That's where the SOH is coming from.

181
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:12,466
And then we're JOINing a Sales.SalesOrderDetail AS SOD, and then

182
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:14,466
what we're going to do is we want to return content. These first

183
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:18,383
two columns are coming from the header table. These remaining

184
00:11:18,466 --> 00:11:21,466
three columns are coming from the details table. So we're going

185
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:25,466
to JOIN the tables based on the SalesOrderID. They have to have

186
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:29,400
that common column. We're going to JOIN the tables on that SalesOrderID,

187
00:11:29,483 --> 00:11:33,166
and that's going to return the content or individual columns

188
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:34,466
from both of those tables

189
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:37,466
in the same result set.

190
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:42,233
>> And, as you can see here, it says JOIN rather than INNER JOIN,

191
00:11:42,316 --> 00:11:45,466
and INNER JOIN is the default. So if you just say JOIN, it will

192
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:49,466
go and do an INNER JOIN. The other thing is, the ON clause is

193
00:11:49,483 --> 00:11:51,466
the second filter clause.

194
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:56,466
Sorry, it's the filter clause. So before WHERE happens, ON happens, logically.

195
00:11:57,366 --> 00:12:00,466
And the ON clause is just like the WHERE clause. You could put

196
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:03,466
basically any predicate in that. It doesn't have to be JOINed

197
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:06,466
on the actual primary key, foreign key relationship. It could

198
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:11,450
be JOIN on this function of this column like something.

199
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,466
That's whatever you put there. Obviously, the results may not

200
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:20,466
be what you're expecting, but JOIN actually fairly frequently

201
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:24,466
you can have lots of benefits from JOINing... or answer interesting

202
00:12:24,483 --> 00:12:29,466
questions from your data when you're actually not JOINing on

203
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,466
the primary key, foreign key relationship.

204
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:34,183
>> What's the difference between an INNER JOIN and an OUTER JOIN?

205
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:39,466
>> So INNER JOIN, you get only the actual combinations across

206
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:45,233
the table or the tables involved, so what you can look at it

207
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:49,466
logically is, you take two tables and you get the massive set

208
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:53,466
of all rows combined with all other rows, and then you apply

209
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,466
the filter in the ON clause.

210
00:12:56,316 --> 00:12:59,466
Obviously, if you apply this, you say this ID equals that ID,

211
00:12:59,483 --> 00:13:03,466
it will only return whatever rows are actually matching across

212
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:09,466
these two tables. So what if, as an example will be, hey, Brian,

213
00:13:09,483 --> 00:13:14,183
please give me all customers and their orders, so you probably

214
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:19,466
will JOIN customer table with order table on customer ID.

215
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:24,433
If I change the question slightly, and this is a good way also

216
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:27,466
of kind of practicing SQL is actually translating a question

217
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:35,166
in English or preferably Swedish, where I'm from, to SQL.

218
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,466
So if I instead say, hey, can you please give me the list of

219
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:42,466
all customers and their orders and also include customers that

220
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:46,366
don't have any orders, because those won't be returned if I use

221
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,466
this INNER JOIN. So the I would instead, if I say FROM customers,

222
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,466
JOIN orders, I would say LEFT JOIN, so LEFT OUTER JOIN, which

223
00:13:56,483 --> 00:14:00,466
is keep the rows that are not matching from the left table, so

224
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:03,466
customers you say first. That would be the left table, and orders

225
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:06,466
would be the right table. So we have LEFT JOIN, keep from the

226
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:08,466
left table, RIGHT JOIN is just keep from the right table, and

227
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:12,466
FULL JOIN is also include orders that don't have a matching customers.

228
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:15,466
That sounds like a referential integrity issue in this case,

229
00:14:15,483 --> 00:14:18,466
but that's basically the OUTER JOINs.

230
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:22,466
>> Okay, excellent. And this is an example of how a LEFT OUTER

231
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,216
JOIN as he just described it would be written. So we're looking

232
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,466
at customers who did not place orders in this case here, so this

233
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:32,466
is an example of that command that Tobias just actually explained

234
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,466
to us. CROSS JOINs.

235
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,400
CROSS JOINs combine each role from the first table with each

236
00:14:38,483 --> 00:14:40,466
row from the second table. What does that give us?

237
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:46,400
We're combining all of the rows from one table to the other table.

238
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:47,466
Why would I use a CROSS JOIN?

239
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:54,366
>> Well, there's not all that many reasons. You could imagine...

240
00:14:54,483 --> 00:15:00,466
so one thing is obviously just generating test data, it's very

241
00:15:00,216 --> 00:15:02,466
practical, because you take one table with 10 rows, CROSS JOIN

242
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:06,466
with another table with 10 rows, you get 100 rows back. But you

243
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,466
could actually have an interesting example such as you have a

244
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:12,466
currency table with all of the currencies and you CROSS JOIN

245
00:15:12,483 --> 00:15:15,216
that with itself, now you get the product of all combinations

246
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,333
of currencies.

247
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:22,466
>> All right, so not heavily used is what I heard, but it is nice

248
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:23,466
to have it out there.

249
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,466
So now we have a SELF JOIN.

250
00:15:26,483 --> 00:15:29,200
So SELF JOIN, compare rows in the same table to each other.

251
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:30,466
Do I have an example of this? I do.

252
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:33,466
>> Well, the currency example I gave was an example of a SELF

253
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:35,466
JOIN, with a CROSS JOIN.

254
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:38,466
>> With a CROSS JOIN. So you can have SELF JOIN with CROSS JOINs.

255
00:15:38,483 --> 00:15:41,466
>> Yes. SELF JOIN is just if you JOIN with yourself.

256
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,466
>> What are the ones most commonly used? I would say the INNER

257
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,466
JOIN, because that's the default. If you just type JOIN, you

258
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:49,466
get INNER, and then your LEFT and RIGHT OUTER JOINs, most likely.

259
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,466
>> Yes, absolutely.

260
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:54,466
>> Then, your SELF JOINs and your CROSs JOINs, they're options,

261
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:58,466
but probably not heavily used. We do have, as you can see here,

262
00:15:58,483 --> 00:16:02,466
examples available to you for how they would be written, but

263
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:07,466
just to kind of give you some ideas on how they would be used.

264
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,466
>> Yes. It's definitely in the order of INNER JOINs and then LEFT

265
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:11,466
JOINs and then FULL JOINs.

266
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:14,466
>> Let's just take a look at a few of these, if we can get just

267
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:19,466
a couple of these to execute. Again, I saved you guys all the

268
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:23,466
headache of me fat-fingering it and trying to type all of this in.

269
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,466
This is that statement that I created earlier, that I showed

270
00:16:26,483 --> 00:16:27,466
you earlier, I should say.

271
00:16:29,483 --> 00:16:33,200
Trying to get it to slide down. There we go. So this is the

272
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,466
one that I had written earlier, or discussed earlier, so this

273
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:40,466
is that sample INNER JOIN, and as Tobias pointed out, I don't

274
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:43,366
have INNER JOIN in there. I could make it a little clearer by

275
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:47,466
putting it as INNER JOIN, so you can see exactly the type of

276
00:16:47,483 --> 00:16:50,466
JOIN it is, but it's the default. So we're going to go ahead

277
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:51,466
and execute this.

278
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:55,466
And notice we have our SalesOrderID. Remember, that's coming

279
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:59,466
from the SOH, which is the order header. We have the OrderDate.

280
00:16:59,483 --> 00:17:03,466
That's also coming from the order header table. And then we

281
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:04,466
have three SOD

282
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:08,466
columns we'll be returning. These are coming from the SalesOrderDetail,

283
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:12,466
so ProductID, UnitPrice and OrderQty. These are being returned

284
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:16,466
from the details. So it's a good way to take content that resides

285
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:21,383
in two different tables. We JOIN them on SalesOrderID... in this

286
00:17:21,466 --> 00:17:25,466
case here, 43659, and return results from two different tables

287
00:17:25,483 --> 00:17:27,350
into one result set.

288
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,466
So it's good that we're able to do that, because often, when

289
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:32,466
we're working with relational databases, we're going to have

290
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:35,383
content multiple tables, and we're going to want to maybe return

291
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:39,0
that content into a single result set, and the use of JOINs will

292
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:42,466
help you perform that. Here's one more example we'll do with

293
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:46,466
a JOIN, and this is the LEFT OUTER JOIN here, and the LEFT OUTER

294
00:17:47,0 --> 00:17:49,466
JOIN is going to return all customers... I just messed that up.

295
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:53,466
Where's my undo in this thing? Undo saves me. There we go.

296
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:59,466
So here's an example of a LEFT OUTER JOIN. Again, we saw this

297
00:17:59,483 --> 00:18:04,466
on the slide, but we have CustomerID and StoreID, SalesOrderID

298
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:08,466
and OrderDate. And you can see here that CUST.StoreID,

299
00:18:10,483 --> 00:18:16,466
these are coming in from the order table, and then the ORD, which

300
00:18:16,483 --> 00:18:20,466
is the SalesOrder header, is the SalesOrderID. So we're grabbing

301
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:24,466
content from the left table or the first query in the statement

302
00:18:25,483 --> 00:18:29,466
and we're adding additional content from the right statement.

303
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:33,466
So just a quick example just to show you that those do run and

304
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:36,433
that when we're displaying them, so just want to show you how

305
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:40,466
those JOINs actually work for you when we're executing those JOINs.

306
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:46,466
All right, so those are ways for retrieving content from inside

307
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,466
of SQL Server from different rows or different tables, if you will.

308
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:54,466
We also have a lot of ways that we want to filter and sort data,

309
00:18:54,483 --> 00:18:58,216
and we use the ORDER BY clause, and I briefly did a demo of this already.

310
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,466
The ORDER BY just sorts the rows,

311
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:05,466
and it's just a way to make the presentation of the content easier

312
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:08,466
for you. You want to be able to see SalesOrderID.

313
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:15,466
We want it in order, and as an integer. Maybe you want customer

314
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:18,433
by last name, you want to sort them alphabetically. Maybe you

315
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:21,466
want order date. We want to know the most recent order or the

316
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:27,466
order that came in in the past. These are examples of ORDER BYs.

317
00:19:27,483 --> 00:19:30,166
So we're doing a SELECT SalesOrderID, CustomerID and OrderDate

318
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,466
from the SalesOrderHeader, and we're going to order it by OrderDate,

319
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:38,466
so we're going to give us three columns, SalesOrderID, CustomerID

320
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:41,466
and OrderDate, and we're going to order it chronologically, I

321
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:44,183
think is the right word, by OrderDate.

322
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,466
We could also go in and do a SELECT SalesOrderID, CustomerID.

323
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:50,433
Now we're gathering the year, and we're going to create a column,

324
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:55,416
the YEAR from the OrderDate, AS OrderYear, again from the SalesOrderHeader,

325
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:59,466
and we're going to ORDER BY OrderYear. This is an alias we created

326
00:19:59,483 --> 00:20:01,466
because we're grabbing just the year from the OrderDate.

327
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:04,466
We're not worried about the time or the date.

328
00:20:04,483 --> 00:20:07,466
>> So here's there's something that's just worth mentioning that

329
00:20:07,483 --> 00:20:12,466
many people typically ask. So you can say AS OrderYear and then

330
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:17,466
ORDER BY this alias OrderYear, but you can't do it as OrderYear

331
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,466
and then in the WHERE clause say WHERE OrderYear is equal to

332
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:23,466
something, and that has to do with this logical query processing

333
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:26,466
that we talked about earlier, because ORDER BY is the only thing

334
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:31,416
that happens after SELECT. So when ORDER BY happens, we know

335
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:34,466
what the column aliases are, but when WHERE happens, we don't

336
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,466
know, because SELECT hasn't happened yet.

337
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:38,466
>> Great point. Definitely great point. And the cool thing is,

338
00:20:38,483 --> 00:20:40,466
we can reverse this. We've got the same...

339
00:20:42,483 --> 00:20:45,466
the top example here is OrderDate. We could do it in reverse

340
00:20:45,483 --> 00:20:49,466
order just by using the descending clause down here. And that

341
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:52,466
gives us the same content, but in reverse order of the dates,

342
00:20:53,0 --> 00:20:56,466
so instead of the most recent... or instead of the earliest

343
00:20:56,483 --> 00:21:00,466
one, we'll have the most recent one on top. We filter data using

344
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:02,466
the WHERE clause. That's one way that we do that. We've seen

345
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:05,466
an example of that, where we had all the rows being dumped out.

346
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:08,466
A little bit overwhelming. So what we've got here is we've got

347
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:12,466
CustomerID, TerritoryID from the Sales.Customer. If I just stop

348
00:21:12,483 --> 00:21:15,466
there and not have a WHERE clause, every row is going to be returned

349
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:17,466
from the Customers table. Well, we're going to throw WHERE TerritoryID

350
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:21,433
= 6, so I want to know where all the customers are that belong

351
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:24,466
in TerritoryID = 6, or I don't have to use equal. I could say

352
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:29,350
WHERE TerritoryID >= 6. So now I want all the customers in territories

353
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:32,466
seven through whatever number it goes through. We could also

354
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:35,266
mix some of these up. In the bottom one, we talk about WHERE

355
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,466
StoreID >= 1000 AND StoreID <= 1200.

356
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:43,466
So I want everything where the StoreID... now, I've moved away

357
00:21:43,483 --> 00:21:48,466
from the TerritoryID. The StoreID is 1000 or higher, but no higher

358
00:21:48,483 --> 00:21:54,466
than 1200, so we've got that little gap area or range that we

359
00:21:54,483 --> 00:21:57,466
want that StoreID or the content for that StoreID to be returned in.

360
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,466
So again, it's controlling what's happening in a result set and

361
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,466
how that content is being displayed to you.

362
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:06,466
Other ways we can filter data. Maybe I want more controls.

363
00:22:06,483 --> 00:22:11,466
I don't want to see every item. Maybe I've got 100,000 or 500,000

364
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:15,466
rows, and I want just a portion of those rows. But what we can

365
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:20,333
do here is use what's called the SELECT TOP option, and we specify

366
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:23,466
the number of items that we want to see. If I do this SELECT

367
00:22:23,483 --> 00:22:26,466
SalesOrderID, CustomerID, from the SalesOrderHeader, and did

368
00:22:26,483 --> 00:22:31,466
ORDER BY TotalDue DESC, I could get 20,000 records. I don't know.

369
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,216
But what I'm saying here is just give me the top 20.

370
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:37,466
So in this SELECT TOP (20), say, I don't what 100,000 records.

371
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:40,466
I want 20 records or whatever number I put in there, so I could

372
00:22:40,483 --> 00:22:43,416
change that to 50 and get the top 50 records. Now, the thing

373
00:22:43,483 --> 00:22:46,466
with that is, if I have 100,000 or 200,000 records and I'm trying

374
00:22:46,483 --> 00:22:51,466
to do this SELECT TOP (20), what if I had 15 and there's eight

375
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:55,466
more that match, that are exactly identical. What this will

376
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:57,466
do is it will SELECT TOP (20) WITH TIES.

377
00:22:58,316 --> 00:23:01,466
Now, instead of displaying just 20, if it hits the 20, if there

378
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:04,466
happens to be 23 because we have some ties, it's going to show

379
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,466
you 23 items, because it doesn't want to show you 20. Let's say,

380
00:23:07,483 --> 00:23:11,466
for instance, we have a salesperson, and the top 20 salespeople

381
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:13,466
in sales get a bonus.

382
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:17,466
Well, if I just did a SELECT TOP (20) and there were 25 people

383
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:21,300
or 23 people that had the top sales but I didn't put the WITH

384
00:23:21,383 --> 00:23:24,466
TIES, there's three people that are not going to get that bonus.

385
00:23:25,0 --> 00:23:26,466
There's three people that are going to be upset with me and the

386
00:23:26,483 --> 00:23:27,466
way I wrote the code.

387
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:32,300
So we can be careful about that. We can avoid the information

388
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:36,466
being ignored or not displayed by using the WITH TIES option.

389
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:39,466
We could just go a percentage. I have 20,000 rows. Instead of

390
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:43,466
going a finite number of rows being returned, we could just do

391
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:47,466
a percentage of items that are returned. So if I have 20,000

392
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:52,466
items, I'll get 20 items. Don't hold me on the math, so we'll

393
00:23:52,483 --> 00:23:53,466
have to see on that here.

394
00:23:53,483 --> 00:23:57,216
>> So I'll show a bit of a demo I thought on TOP, because TOP

395
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,466
is somewhat interesting.

396
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:05,466
So if we switch over to my machine here, what I'd like to show

397
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:09,466
is, first of all, you already saw TOP, right? We also have support

398
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:14,466
now in SQL Server 2012 for OFFSET and the FETCH keywords, which

399
00:24:14,483 --> 00:24:18,466
helps you page through the results, which is very common in web applications.

400
00:24:18,483 --> 00:24:23,466
So let's say I just go for Production.Product and

401
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:26,466
then I say ORDER BY,

402
00:24:28,483 --> 00:24:32,466
I don't know, UnitPrice, is it ListPrice? There we go, ListPrice.

403
00:24:32,483 --> 00:24:35,466
Now, this will give me the full result set back. What I can

404
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:40,466
now go and do is say, well, please OFFSET 10 ROWS

405
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:43,466
and FETCH

406
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,466
NEXT 10 ROWS ONLY,

407
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:53,466
and that will actually give me the rows 11 through 20, and now

408
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:59,466
I can go and say you see the first one here is Chainring, apparently.

409
00:24:59,483 --> 00:25:04,466
If I go and say, well, SKIP 20 ROWS, it's still...

410
00:25:06,483 --> 00:25:08,466
>> Or OFFSET 20 ROWS.

411
00:25:10,483 --> 00:25:11,466
>> Oh, sorry.

412
00:25:11,483 --> 00:25:14,266
Let's see here.

413
00:25:15,483 --> 00:25:18,466
Now there is something. So what's going on here? Well, these

414
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:23,466
guys all have the same list price, so by accident I showed you

415
00:25:23,483 --> 00:25:25,466
an even better example. This is amazing.

416
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:26,283
>> Exactly.

417
00:25:26,366 --> 00:25:32,450
>> Oh, how good we are, Brian. This is really good. So here we

418
00:25:32,483 --> 00:25:37,466
see a problem that is common with basically both TOP and OFFSET

419
00:25:37,483 --> 00:25:39,466
and FETCH, which is what happens if I don't order by something

420
00:25:40,0 --> 00:25:44,466
that's unique. So let's go and add ProductID in here, which will

421
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:46,333
make it make some more sense.

422
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:50,466
Now, okay, Fork Crown is apparently the top row, and then I'll

423
00:25:50,483 --> 00:25:51,466
go and say, well, 40...

424
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:56,0
I'm jumping now forward. And you obviously can use variables

425
00:25:56,483 --> 00:26:02,233
and expressions, so I could say here @ OFFSET as I'm passing in.

426
00:26:02,316 --> 00:26:04,466
So that's one thing I wanted to show you guys, which is interesting.

427
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:08,166
The other thing, which is a bit special and we haven't talked

428
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,466
about UNION, because we don't have it particularly in any of

429
00:26:11,483 --> 00:26:17,466
our slides, but UNION is the combination of result sets by concatenating

430
00:26:17,483 --> 00:26:22,233
them rather than JOIN, which is combining them horizontally.

431
00:26:22,316 --> 00:26:28,466
So I have an example query that let's say Brian just asked me,

432
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:33,466
hello, Tobias, can I get the two most expensive black products

433
00:26:33,483 --> 00:26:37,466
and the two most expensive red products in a query. And you

434
00:26:37,483 --> 00:26:39,466
go, okay, that sounds like a reasonable question, Brian.

435
00:26:39,483 --> 00:26:40,466
>> For a Lamborghini.

436
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:45,466
>> Yes, yes. So I'll go, okay, let's get Name and

437
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:49,466
ListPrice and Color.

438
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,466
It must be a fairly boring product, since the only have one color,

439
00:26:53,483 --> 00:27:00,466
but anyhow. And I probably want top two, right, and then WHERE

440
00:27:00,483 --> 00:27:06,250
Color = "Black" in this case, and I don't know if black is actually

441
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:11,466
a color and how that works, but at any rate. And obviously ORDER

442
00:27:11,483 --> 00:27:16,233
BY is important here. You say ORDER BY ListPrice DESC, since

443
00:27:16,316 --> 00:27:19,466
we want the most expensive products. Okay, so that happens to

444
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:21,466
be this Mountain 100 Black.

445
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:23,466
>> I think it's a mountain bike or something.

446
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:25,466
>> Well, you never know.

447
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:26,466
>> Never know.

448
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:30,466
>> And the I also wanted the red product, so that seemed like

449
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:35,466
a separate query, so also give me the two most expensive red products.

450
00:27:36,0 --> 00:27:39,466
Okay, there we have those. Now, this UNION clause will be very

451
00:27:39,483 --> 00:27:42,466
interesting, because that's, again, just taking these without

452
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:47,466
result sets and smashing them together, so I'll say UNION ALL.

453
00:27:47,483 --> 00:27:51,466
UNION is implicitly a DISTINCT, so you will automatically go

454
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:55,466
and remove duplicates. That's per the standard, and obviously that's...

455
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:58,466
if you know there are no duplicates between the sets, why pay

456
00:27:58,483 --> 00:28:01,466
the cost doing it, so UNION ALL means don't remove duplicates.

457
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:04,466
Actually, the SELECT statement, you can say SELECT ALL, means

458
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:08,466
the same, but no one ever types it. So SELECT DISTINCT and SELECT ALL.

459
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:11,466
So now, we see there is a red squiggly here, right?

460
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:16,400
So if I try this, it will start complaining and say, hey, Tobias,

461
00:28:16,483 --> 00:28:21,466
this doesn't really make sense. Because ORDER BY is at the set level.

462
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:24,466
It's at the result set level, so what we're going to actually return.

463
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:26,466
So we know...

464
00:28:28,483 --> 00:28:30,466
something happened on my screen.

465
00:28:30,483 --> 00:28:32,466
Well, now

466
00:28:34,483 --> 00:28:35,466
we see me, but not the screen.

467
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:38,466
>> We're back to you. Should we go back to the demo?

468
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,466
>> So now you can see me typing.

469
00:28:41,216 --> 00:28:44,316
>> Pretend he's typing the keys that you were just looking at.

470
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:49,466
>> Wonderful. Here we go. So, again, we saw this was the two most

471
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:54,466
expensive black and these were the two most expensive, so about 3000.

472
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,466
So let's just remove this ORDER BY clause,

473
00:28:59,366 --> 00:29:01,466
and we now get something completely different back. And this

474
00:29:02,483 --> 00:29:06,350
is because of the logical processing of the query, right, because

475
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:07,466
first we go and do

476
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:12,466
the FROM clause, the WHERE clause, so we get all of the black

477
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:17,466
products, and then we get just the top first two that we find.

478
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:20,466
And then we go and do the same with the red products, the top

479
00:29:20,483 --> 00:29:23,383
first that we find, then we concatenate the result sets and then

480
00:29:23,466 --> 00:29:27,466
we sort the result set. So if you turn on the query execution

481
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:32,466
plan that we can find up here, this is something also people

482
00:29:32,483 --> 00:29:35,466
use to basically optimize their queries, but it can also be very

483
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,466
useful to actually just understand what's going on. So if I

484
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:41,466
look at the execution plan here, we can see, we apparently go

485
00:29:41,483 --> 00:29:45,466
and scan an index here, which is the table, the clustered index.

486
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,466
Then we do top immediately.

487
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:50,466
There's no sorting that happens before that. Then we concatenate

488
00:29:50,483 --> 00:29:54,466
the result sets, and now we go sort based on color.

489
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:59,466
So what I want to do is, instead of this, which there is no...

490
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:02,466
it's not a bug in the product, right? It's just the way that

491
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:06,333
the language works. Instead I can do... and this we will get

492
00:30:06,416 --> 00:30:09,466
into more details on later, but I can do a derive table here

493
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:12,466
and say, well, FROM this SELECT clause.

494
00:30:13,483 --> 00:30:17,466
Now, it's not ambiguous anymore. I'm saying, well, grab this

495
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:21,466
result set. Now it's the two most expensive black products, and

496
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:23,466
then concatenate that with the

497
00:30:25,333 --> 00:30:28,466
two most expensive red products.

498
00:30:28,483 --> 00:30:32,233
We have to have aliases here on the tables here or on these sets.

499
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:36,416
And now we'll get the right result. And now I can obviously

500
00:30:36,483 --> 00:30:38,466
also add an ORDER BY down here and say, well, I would like to

501
00:30:38,483 --> 00:30:44,183
order by name. So that result set, I want those four rows sorted

502
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:44,466
by name.

503
00:30:45,483 --> 00:30:48,466
So we get that back, seems to make sense, and now the execution

504
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:51,466
plan, we can see we have a different operator here, which is

505
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:54,466
now the top sort operator.

506
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,333
Then we concatenate and then we sort the result set.

507
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:57,466
>> Nice.

508
00:30:57,483 --> 00:31:02,466
>> So here we can just see, what does UNION do, which can clearly

509
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,466
be useful, and actually how TOP intersects with ORDER BY.

510
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:09,466
>> All right, excellent. Great demo. All right, so that's going

511
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:13,466
to wrap up module two here. We talked about the SELECT statement,

512
00:31:13,483 --> 00:31:16,466
we introduced the DISTINCT, reduce. There is some overhead involved,

513
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:19,466
as Tobias pointed out to us, about the DISTINCT removes those

514
00:31:19,483 --> 00:31:23,466
redundant roles. We introduced both column and table aliases.

515
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:26,466
We talked about the CASE statement. We talked about the few

516
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:28,466
different types of JOINs that we are going to be comfortable

517
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:32,266
or need to get comfortable working with. Specifically, the default

518
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,0
one is the INNER JOIN, and we have the OUTER JOINs. We looked

519
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:39,350
at the ORDER BY and the WHERE clause. We had a nice demo from

520
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:43,466
Tobias on the UNION clause, and we also talked about the TOP

521
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:47,466
clause in this area, here. So let's go ahead and take a 10-minteu

522
00:31:47,483 --> 00:31:50,466
break, and what we do when we come back, when we come back, we're

523
00:31:50,483 --> 00:31:52,466
going to go into the next module.

524
00:31:53,483 --> 00:31:56,466
And when we go to the next module, we're going to start talking

525
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:59,466
about some additional... again, more advanced topics when we're

526
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:05,250
looking at ways for us to query content from SQL Server 2012.
